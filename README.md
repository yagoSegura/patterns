 *Benefits*

  * It isolates the client from concrete implementation classes
  * It eases the exchanging of object families
  * It promotes consistency among objects

 *Applicable scenarios*

  * The system needs to be independent of how it's objects are created, composed and represented
  * The system needs to be configured with one of multiple families of objects
  * The family of related objects is intended to be used together, and this constraint needs to be enforced
  * You want to provide a library of objects that does not show implementations and only reveals interfaces
